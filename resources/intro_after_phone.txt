You pick up the phone,
there is a creepy voice on the other end:
WE WILL TRAP ALL THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.
THE DOOR IS LOCKED. IF YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH,
TRY TO LOOK FOR CLUES AND HELP YOURSELF.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE!
ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE! HA HA HA...

You hang up the phone, and go to the door.
It IS LOCKED! The door lock requires a 3 digit password.
You try some random numbers, but none of them work.

Fine....
