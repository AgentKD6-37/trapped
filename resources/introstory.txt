Ah, what a headache...

You open your eyes, to find yourself in a dark and smelly room.
You start looking around, and you just see that you woke up in a different bed than you are used to.
You have no clue what happened last night or how you got here.
All you know is that you went to a friend's birthday party, and you drank lots of Margaritas.
You must have blacked out...
Are you trapped inside this place? How can you get out? 

A phone is ringing......
