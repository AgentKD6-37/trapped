Ahh.. what a headache....
You opened your eyes, it's a dark and smelly room...
You look around, and you found your self woke up from a bed.
You even can't remember what happened last night. 
The only thing you remembered was... you went to a friend's birthday party.
You drank a lot of Margaritas, and then you can't remember anything after that...
Did somebody trapped you here?
...

The phone rings.
You pick up the phone, there is a creepy and scary sounds:
WE WILL TRAP ALL THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. THE DOOR IS LOCKED. IF YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH, TRY TO
LOOK FOR CLUES AND HELP YOURSELF. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE! ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE! HA HA HA...

You still cannot believe this, hang up the phone, and go to the door.
It IS LOCKED! The door lock required 3 digit password. 
You tried random numbers, but neither works.

Fine....

You decided to try....
