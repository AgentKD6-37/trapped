Ahh.. what a headache....
You opened your eyes, it's a dark and smelly room...
You look around, and you found your self woke up from a bed.
You even can't remember what happened last night. 
The only thing you remembered was... you went to a friend's birthday party.
You drank a lot of Margaritas, and then you can't remember anything after that...
Did somebody trapped you here?
...

The phone rings...
